# 🌱 Conscious Consumption

> *Transform mindless scrolling into mindful living.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**Conscious Consumption** is an AI-powered reflection journal designed to improve **digital well-being, mental health, and productivity**.
Instead of just tracking screen time, we help users reflect on **how their digital habits make them feel** — and provide personalized, AI-driven suggestions to build **healthier micro-habits**.

---

## 🚨 Problem

* Young adults (15–30) spend **4–6 hours daily** on social media.
* That’s **1,500+ hours/year**, equal to losing *two months of life*.
* Impact:

  * Anxiety, stress, depression
  * Reduced productivity & confidence
  * Silent drain on potential

This is not just a lifestyle issue — it’s a **crisis of wasted human potential**.
